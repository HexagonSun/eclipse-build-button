# eclipse-build-button
A tiny Eclipse plugin that provides toolbar buttons to do one thing, and do it well:

* clean & build all projects in the workspace
* clean & build the currently selected projects

Developped & tested with Eclipse Luna on OS X. Should work in other recent versions of Eclipse and other platforms, too.

### Why should you use it?

If you're like me, your daily struggle with Eclipse and plugins for it frequently cause you to require a "clean project". Each time this causes several clicks:
 1. Menu "Project"
 2. Select "Cleanâ€¦"
 3. Select desired projects or "selected below"
 4. "OK"

After years of doing this dance I was fed up and decided to write this little plugin. It allows with one click - or keyboard shortcut - to instantly trigger the cleaning & (re)building of your projects.
